A game based on the meme image of a guy running around a computer store, hacking
all the computers.

Created for GitHub Game Off 2016

Written using my own open-source game engine, [Qor](http://github.com/flipcoder/qor).

Run around the computer store with WASD and the mouse,
hacking computers with left click.
If anyone working at the store sees you, you lose.
