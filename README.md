Created for GitHub Game Off 2016 by Grady O'Connell and Mark "Alfred" McDaniel

A stealth hacking game where you run around a computer store, hacking all the computers.
Inspired by the gif.

Written using my own open-source game engine, [Qor](http://github.com/flipcoder/qor).

## Download

[Windows build](http://filedropper.com/hackinginprogress)

Linux build will be available soon.

## How to Play

Run around the computer store with WASD and the mouse,
hacking computers with left click.
If anyone working at the store sees you hack, you lose.
